00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:19,621
I believe in America.

3
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:22,707
America has made my fortune.

4
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:26,961
And I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

5
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:31,841
I gave her freedom, but I taught her
never to dishonor her family.

6
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,429
She found a boyfriend, not an Italian.

7
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:40,975
She went to the movies with him.
She stayed out late.

8
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,727
I didn't protest.

9
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:48,525
Two months ago he took her for a drive
with another boyfriend.

10
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:52,195
They made her drink whiskey

11
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,658
and then they tried to
take advantage of her.

12
00:01:56,741 --> 00:02:00,870
She resisted, she kept her honor.

13
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:05,208
So they beat her like an animal.

14
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:12,006
When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken,

15
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,553
her jaw was shattered,
held together by wire.

16
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:22,225
She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

17
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:27,730
But I wept. Why did I weep?

18
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,735
She was the light of my life.

19
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,406
Beautiful girl.

20
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:43,079
Now she will never be beautiful again.

22

Sorry.

23
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:03,933
I went to the police,
like a good American.

24
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,728
These two boys were brought to trial.

25
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,565
The judge sentenced them
to three years in prison,

26
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,775
but suspended the sentence.

27
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:18,948
Suspended the sentence!
They went free that very day!

28
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,537
I stood in the courtroom like a fool.

29
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:28,124
Those two bastards, they smiled at me.

30
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:34,964
Then I said to my wife, " For justice,
we must go to Don Corleone. "

anything, but do what I beg you to do.

I'll give you anything you ask.

37

I've known you many years, but this
is the first time you've asked for help.

38
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:37,068
I can't remember the last time
you invited me for a cup of coffee.

39
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:41,990
Even though my wife is godmother
to your only child.

40
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:47,078
But let's be frank here.
You never wanted my friendship.

41
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:50,915
And you were afraid to be in my debt.

42
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,418
BONASERA: I didn't want to
get into trouble.

43
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,212
I understand.

44
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,550
You found Paradise in America.

45
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:07,515
You made a good living, had police
protection and there were courts of law.

46
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:10,351
You didn't need a friend like me.

47
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:15,523
But now you come to me and say,

48
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,067
" Don Corleone, give me justice. "

49
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,780
But you don't ask with respect.

50
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:27,577
You don't offer friendship. You don't
even think to call me Godfather.

51
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:36,210
You come on my daughter's wedding
day and ask me to murder for money.

52
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,838
BONASERA: I ask you for justice.

53
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,924
That is notjustice.
Your daughter is alive.

54
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:46,429
Let them suffer , then, as she suffers.

55
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,808
How much shall I pay you?

56
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,410
Bonasera, Bonasera.

57
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:13,623
What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?

58
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,251
If you'd come in friendship,

59
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:21,798
the scum that ruined your daughter
would be suffering this very day.

60
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:28,096
And if an honest man like you should
make enemies, they'd be my enemies.

61
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,810
And then they would fear you.

62

63
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,987

64
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,493
Good.

65
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:57,834
Some day, and that day may never
come, I'll ask a service of you.

66
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,337
But until that day

with a big bandleader.

-Luca Brasi held a gun to his head,

Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz

We trained her for five years.
Singing, acting, dancing lessons.

303
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:35,768
I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on her , to make her a big star.

Let me be even more frank.

305
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:43,693
To show you that  not a hard -hearted
man. That it's not all dollars and cents.

306
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:47,447
She was beautiful.
She was young and innocent!

307
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:52,911

It's true,
I have a lot of friends in politics.

which they regard as a harmless vice,
but drugs is a dirty business.

McCluskey has agreed
to be The Turk's bodyguard.

So when Sollozzo is being guarded,
he's invulnerable.

1077
02:08:23,696 --> 02:08:27,449
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?

1078
02:08:27,574 --> 02:08:29,910
All of you know me.

1079
02:08:30,869 --> 02:08:36,041
When did I ever refuse,
except one time? And why?

1080
02:08:37,710 --> 02:08:43,549
Because I believe this drug business
will destroy us in the years to come.

1081
02:08:43,632 --> 02:08:47,886
It's not like gambling or liquor
or even women,

1082
02:08:47,970 --> 02:08:53,934
which is something that most people
want, but is forbidden by the Church.

1083
02:08:54,059 --> 02:08:58,731
Even the police that have helped us in
the past with gambling and other things

1084
02:08:58,814 --> 02:09:03,068
are going to refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

1085
02:09:03,152 --> 02:09:08,240
I believed that then
and I believe that now.

1086
02:09:08,323 --> 02:09:10,534
Times have changed.

1087
02:09:10,659 --> 02:09:15,414
It's not like the old days,
when we could do anything we wanted.

1088
02:09:15,497 --> 02:09:18,333
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

1089
02:09:18,459 --> 02:09:23,839
If Don Corleone had all the judges and
politicians, then he must share them

1090
02:09:23,964 --> 02:09:28,510
or let others use them. He must let us
draw the water from the well.

1091
02:09:29,595 --> 02:09:33,182
Certainly he can present a bill
for such services.

1092
02:09:33,307 --> 02:09:35,851
After all, we're not communists.

1093
02:09:38,979 --> 02:09:42,065
I also don't believe in drugs.

1094
02:09:42,191 --> 02:09:47,029
For years I paid my people extra, so
they wouldn't do that kind of business.

1095
02:09:47,154 --> 02:09:50,282
Somebody says to them
" I have powders. "

1096
02:09:50,365 --> 02:09:53,869
" If you put up
3 -4,000 dollar investment,

1097
02:09:53,994 --> 02:09:56,455
we can make 50 ,000 distributing. "

1098
02:09:57,873 --> 02:10:03,879
They can't resist. I want to control it
as a business, keep it respectable.

1099
02:10:03,962 --> 02:10:08,717
I don't want it near schools,
I don't want it sold to children.

1100
02:10:08,842 --> 02:10:10,636
<i>That's an inf√†mia.</i>

1101
02:10:11,970 --> 02:10:15,891
In my city we would keep the traffic
to the colored.

1102
02:10:15,974 --> 02:10:19,144
They're animals,
so let them lose their souls.

1103
02:10:25,734 --> 02:10:29,363
I hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

1104
02:10:30,739 --> 02:10:37,412
And  willing to do whatever is
necessary to find a peaceful solution.

1105
02:10:37,996 --> 02:10:42,501
We are agreed. The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.

1106
02:10:42,584 --> 02:10:46,922
Don Corleone will give us protection
in the east, and there will be peace.

1107
02:10:47,047 --> 02:10:50,759
I must have strict assurance
from Corleone.

1108
02:10:50,884 --> 02:10:54,179
As time goes by
and his position becomes stronger ,

1109
02:10:54,263 --> 02:10:56,849
will he attempt any individual vendetta?

1110
02:10:56,932 --> 02:11:02,104
BARZINI : We are all reasonable men.
We don't have to give assurances.

1111
02:11:02,229 --> 02:11:05,107
You talk about vengeance.

1112
02:11:05,190 --> 02:11:08,443
Will vengeance
bring your son back to you?

1113
02:11:08,527 --> 02:11:11,029
Or my boy to me?

1114
02:11:11,113 --> 02:11:13,907
I forgo the vengeance of my son.

1115
02:11:16,702 --> 02:11:19,037
But I have selfish reasons.

1116
02:11:21,290 --> 02:11:24,877
My youngest son was forced
to leave this country

1117
02:11:26,753 --> 02:11:29,298
because of this Sollozzo business.

1118
02:11:30,883 --> 02:11:34,720
And I have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely.

1119
02:11:34,803 --> 02:11:37,472
Cleared of all these false charges.

1120
02:11:38,932 --> 02:11:42,102
But  a superstitious man.

1121
02:11:42,227 --> 02:11:47,482
If an unlucky accident should befall him,
if he should be shot by a police officer¬§,

1122
02:11:48,901 --> 02:11:52,487
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell,

1123
02:11:52,571 --> 02:11:55,407
or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning,

1124
02:11:56,658 --> 02:12:00,287
then  going to blame
some of the people in this room.

1125
02:12:01,955 --> 02:12:04,291
And that I do not forgive.

1126
02:12:06,752 --> 02:12:09,129
But, that aside

1127
02:12:12,174 --> 02:12:14,593
let me say that I swear

1128
02:12:16,178 --> 02:12:19,306
on the souls of my grandchildren,

1129
02:12:19,431 --> 02:12:23,769
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

1130
02:12:49,294 --> 02:12:54,758
Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's
drug middlemen have clean records?

1131
02:12:54,841 --> 02:12:56,927
Mention it. Don't insist.

1132
02:12:58,929 --> 02:13:03,850
-Barzini will know without being told.
-You mean Tattaglia.

1133
02:13:05,477 --> 02:13:07,437
Tattaglia's a pimp.

1134
02:13:08,522 --> 02:13:11,650
He could never have outfought Santino.

1135
02:13:14,027 --> 02:13:19,616
But I didn't know until this day
that it was Barzini all along.

1136
02:13:35,090 --> 02:13:37,175
Come on, Nancy.

1137
02:13:38,385 --> 02:13:40,971
Keep together , everyone. Brian.

1138
02:13:42,305 --> 02:13:43,974
Okay, all right.

1139
02:13:57,029 --> 02:13:59,239
How long have you been back?

1140
02:14:00,032 --> 02:14:01,867
I've been back a year.

1141
02:14:03,285 --> 02:14:05,412
Longer than that, I think.

1142
02:14:08,248 --> 02:14:10,417
It's good to see you, Kay.

1143
02:14:21,428 --> 02:14:23,972
working for my father now, Kay.

1144
02:14:26,475 --> 02:14:29,478
He's been sick. Very sick.

1145
02:14:31,021 --> 02:14:32,981
But you're not like him.

1146
02:14:33,065 --> 02:14:36,860
You told me you weren't going to
become like your father.

1147
02:14:38,820 --> 02:14:43,116
My father is no different
than any other powerful man.

1148
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:46,703
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

1149
02:14:47,871 --> 02:14:50,332
Like a senator or president.

1150
02:14:50,415 --> 02:14:52,876
-How naive you sound.
-Why?

1151
02:14:52,959 --> 02:14:55,754
They don't have men killed.

1152
02:14:58,965 --> 02:15:00,967
Who's being naive, Kay?

1153
02:15:02,260 --> 02:15:06,515
My father's way of doing things is over.
Even he knows that.

1154
02:15:08,058 --> 02:15:12,437
In five years the Corleone family
is going to be completely legitimate.

1155
02:15:14,272 --> 02:15:18,235
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business. Kay...

1156
02:15:19,653 --> 02:15:22,781
Michael, why did you come here? Why?

1157
02:15:24,116 --> 02:15:28,954
What do you want with me after all
this time? I've been calling and writing.

1158
02:15:29,037 --> 02:15:32,541
I came because I need you.
I care for you.

1159
02:15:32,624 --> 02:15:36,461
-Please stop it, Michael.
-Because... I want you to marry me.

1160
02:15:38,130 --> 02:15:40,757
-It's too late.
-Please, Kay...

1161
02:15:42,467 --> 02:15:46,388
I'll do anything you ask
to make up for what's happened to us.

1162
02:15:48,223 --> 02:15:52,477
Because that's important, Kay.
Because what's important is that

1163
02:15:54,020 --> 02:15:57,274
we have each other.
That we have a life together.

1164
02:15:58,859 --> 02:16:01,570
That we have children. Our children.

1165
02:16:03,071 --> 02:16:05,240
Kay, I need you.

1166
02:16:07,200 --> 02:16:08,785
And I love you.

1167
02:16:30,891 --> 02:16:34,686
TESSIO: Barzini's people chisel
my territory and we do nothing about it!

1168
02:16:34,811 --> 02:16:38,440
-Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat!
-M ICHAEL: Be patient.

1169
02:16:38,523 --> 02:16:41,651
TESSIO:  not asking for help.
Just take off the handcuffs.

1170
02:16:41,735 --> 02:16:44,863
M ICHAEL: Be patient.
CARLO: We must protect ourselves.

1171
02:16:44,946 --> 02:16:48,408
-Let me recruit some new men.
-M ICHAEL: No.

1172
02:16:48,491 --> 02:16:52,370
-Barzini would get an excuse to fight.
-TESSIO: Mike, you're wrong.

1173
02:16:53,872 --> 02:16:56,082
CLEMENZA: Don Corleone...

1174
02:16:56,166 --> 02:17:00,253
You once said that one day Tessio
and me could form our own family.

1175
02:17:00,337 --> 02:17:04,382
Till today I would never think of it.
I must ask your permission.

1176
02:17:05,383 --> 02:17:08,094
Michael is now head of the family.

1177
02:17:08,178 --> 02:17:12,432
If he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

1178
02:17:12,515 --> 02:17:14,935
After we make the move to Nevada

1179
02:17:15,018 --> 02:17:19,397
you can leave the Corleone family
and go on your own.

1180
02:17:19,481 --> 02:17:23,818
-TESSIO: How long will that be?
-Six months.

1181
02:17:23,902 --> 02:17:27,155
Forgive me, but with you gone,

1182
02:17:27,239 --> 02:17:30,075
me and Pete
will come under Barzini's thumb.

1183
02:17:30,158 --> 02:17:35,830
I hate that Barzini. In six months' time
there will be nothing left to build on.

1184
02:17:35,914 --> 02:17:38,833
-Do you have faith in my judgment?
-Yes.

1185
02:17:38,917 --> 02:17:41,836
-Do I have your loyalty?
-Always, Godfather.

1186
02:17:41,962 --> 02:17:45,215
Then be a friend to Michael.
Do as he says.

1187
02:17:50,095 --> 02:17:55,475
Things are negotiated that'll solve your
problems and answer your questions.

1188
02:17:55,558 --> 02:17:57,852
That's all I can tell you now.

1189
02:17:58,687 --> 02:18:01,314
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

1190
02:18:01,398 --> 02:18:04,734
When we make our move there,
you'll be my right -hand man.

1191
02:18:04,818 --> 02:18:09,614
Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere.
He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.

1192
02:18:09,698 --> 02:18:12,242
That's no reflection on Tom,
just how I want it.

1193
02:18:12,325 --> 02:18:17,038
If I ever need help, who's a better
consigliere than my father? That's it.

1194
02:18:37,058 --> 02:18:40,895
-Thank you, Papa.
- happy for you, Carlo.

1195
02:18:40,979 --> 02:18:43,857
Mike... Why am I out?

1196
02:18:45,358 --> 02:18:48,111
You're not a wartime consigliere. Tom.

1197
02:18:49,404 --> 02:18:52,657
Things may get rough with the move.

1198
02:18:52,741 --> 02:18:54,034
Tom.

1199
02:18:59,205 --> 02:19:04,377
I advised Michael. I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.

1200
02:19:04,461 --> 02:19:08,590
I thought Santino was a bad Don,
rest in peace.

1201
02:19:10,050 --> 02:19:13,261
Michael has all my confidence,
just as you do.

1202
02:19:14,220 --> 02:19:19,225
But there are reasons why you must
have no part in what is going to happen.

1203
02:19:20,268 --> 02:19:23,313
-Maybe I could help.
-You're out, Tom.

1204

1205
02:20:12,570 --> 02:20:16,866
I can't get over the way your face looks.
So good!

1206
02:20:16,991 --> 02:20:21,538
This doctor did some job.
Did Kay talk you into it? Hey, hey, hey!

1207
02:20:21,621 --> 02:20:25,750
Leave them out here.
He's tired and wants to clean up.

1208
02:20:25,834 --> 02:20:28,169
Let me open the door , all right?

FREDO: Girls?

-Who are the girls?

-That's for you to find out.
-Get rid of them, Fredo.

-Hey, Mike...
- here on business. Get rid of them.

02:21:05,331 --> 02:21:08,001
tired. Get rid of the band too.

What happened to Moe Greene?

1224
02:21:44,496 --> 02:21:48,875
He had some business. He said to
give him a call when the party started.

1225
02:21:48,958 --> 02:21:50,877
Well, give him a call.

1226
02:21:52,212 --> 02:21:55,381
-Johnny, how are you?
-Nice to see you, Mike.

1227
02:21:55,465 --> 02:21:57,675
M ICHAEL: We're proud of you.
JOHNNY: Thanks.

1228
02:21:57,759 --> 02:22:01,387
Sit down, I want to talk to you.
The Don is proud too.

1229
02:22:01,471 --> 02:22:03,681
Well, I owe it all to him.

1230
02:22:04,891 --> 02:22:06,476
He knows how grateful you are.

1231
02:22:06,559 --> 02:22:09,812
That's why
he'd like to ask a favor of you.

1232
02:22:09,896 --> 02:22:11,814
Mike, what can I do?

1233
02:22:12,982 --> 02:22:15,443
We're thinking of giving up our interests

1234
02:22:15,527 --> 02:22:18,404
in the olive oil business
and settling here.

1235
02:22:19,239 --> 02:22:24,619
Moe will sell us his share of the casino
and the hotel, so we'll own all of it.

1236
02:22:24,702 --> 02:22:27,455
-Tom!
-Are you sure?

1237
02:22:27,539 --> 02:22:30,542
Moe loves the business.
He never said nothing about selling.

1238
02:22:30,625 --> 02:22:33,336
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

1239
02:22:34,587 --> 02:22:37,048
See, Johnny...

1240
02:22:37,131 --> 02:22:41,344
We figure that entertainment
would draw gamblers to the casino.

1241
02:22:41,427 --> 02:22:45,181
We hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

1242
02:22:48,101 --> 02:22:52,730
Perhaps convince some of your friends
in the movies to do the same.

1243

We're counting on you.

1244

Sure, Mike.
I'll do anything for my godfather.

1245
02:23:01,864 --> 02:23:03,157
Good.

1246

Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.

-Good to see you.
-How are you, Moe?

1248
02:23:12,166 --> 02:23:17,255
Have everything? Specially prepared
food, the best dancers, and good credit.

1249
02:23:17,338 --> 02:23:20,925
Draw chips for everybody,
so they can play on the house.

1250
02:23:23,595 --> 02:23:26,306
Is my credit good enough
to buy you out?

1251
02:23:28,099 --> 02:23:29,934
Buy me out?

1252
02:23:30,018 --> 02:23:32,604
The casino, the hotel.

1253
02:23:32,687 --> 02:23:35,607
The Corleone family
wants to buy you out.

1254
02:23:35,690 --> 02:23:41,112
The Corleone family wants
to buy me out? No, I buy you out.

1255
02:23:41,195 --> 02:23:44,616
Your casino loses money.
We can do better.

1256

-You're unlucky.

I took Freddy in when you had a bad
time, and now you try to push me out!

1259
02:24:01,841 --> 02:24:05,345
You did that
because we bankrolled your casino

1260
02:24:10,767 --> 02:24:13,519
Yes. First of all, you're all done.

1261

You don't have
that kind of muscle anymore.

1262

The Godfather is sick. You're getting
chased out of New York by the others.

1263

Do you think you can come to my hotel
and take over?

1264
02:24:24,614 --> 02:24:29,661
I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal
with him and still keep my hotel!

1265
02:24:29,744 --> 02:24:33,247
Is that why you slapped my brother
around in public?

1266
02:24:33,331 --> 02:24:38,169
That was nothing, Mike.
Moe didn't mean nothing by that.

1267
02:24:38,252 --> 02:24:42,465
He flies off the handle sometimes,
but we're good friends.

1268

I have a business to run.
I've got to kick asses sometimes.

1269
02:24:47,387 --> 02:24:51,265
We had an argument,
so I had to straighten him out.

1270

You straightened my brother out?

1271

He was banging cocktail waitresses!
Players couldn't get a drink.

-She's afraid to.

Barzini will move against you first.

He'll set up a meeting with someone
